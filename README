ActiveKai
=========

Rails Plugin for Kai (http://sourceforge.net/projects/kai/)


Example
=======

 class Book < ActiveKai
   kai_servers ['192.168.10.1:11211','192.168.10.2:11211','192.168.10.2:11211']
 end

 book = Book.new(:id => 12345,:title => "Learning Erlang",:author => "John")
 puts book.author #=> john
 book.save 
 # The key on Kai is generated by :id parameter.
 # So,you have to specify :id on each object

 b2 = Book.find(12345)
 b2.title = "Learning Erlang 2nd Ed."
 b2.save


DESCRIPTION
===========
You can read/write any data on Kai with ActiveRecord-like style.Notice that
Kai is key-value storage,so you have to specify key by some means.Now,this plugin 
generates key string from :id parameter.

The key string is made from :id,class name and RAILS_ENV.If you want to see
exact key string,call #key method on the object.

CONFIGURATION
=============

You can specify hosts and ports as follows.

1.In a enviroments/(development|test|production).rb
 
 ActiveKai.servers = ['192.168.10.1:11211','192.168.10.2:11211','192.168.10.2:11211']

2.In a subclass

 class Book < ActiveKai
   kai_servers ['192.168.10.1:11211','192.168.10.2:11211','192.168.10.2:11211']
 end

Notice that server setting is shared in all subclass in a application.So the way 1 
is preferable.
